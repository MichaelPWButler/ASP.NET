## Air Fryer Conversion
This was a small project to learn more about CSS. It also solved a real-world problem for someone who always uses an air fryer. I learnt a lot about CSS in this project and implemented it through the use of themes in this project. The project containing a button to switch between LIGHT and DARK theme.
