# ASP.NET Projects

This repository contains all of my ASP.NET projects. From small projects such as the air fryer conversion repostory to ongoing projects such as the higher or lower game. I am always looking to improve on my projects , but also making thigs that i enjoy making. 
Programming should always be fun.

## Air Fryer Conversion
This was a small project to learn more about CSS. It also solved a real-world problem for someone who always uses an air fryer. I learnt a lot about CSS in this project and implemented that through the use of themes in this project. The project containing a button to switch between LIGHT and DARK theme.
