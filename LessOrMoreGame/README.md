## Higher Lower Game
This is a small (not original) game that I wanted to put my own spin on with a focus on counties and some nice web effects, such as basic animations to make it more interactive. 
In this project, I learnt more about Razor Pages, creating services, using JSON data in a program and more complex JavaScript in an ASP.NET Project.
